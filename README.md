The Gearbag application is a sample tool for assembling a collection of devices from a master list on iFixit's database. The gearbag is a place for users to show off their stuff. The list is stored in the users' browser, using HTML5's SQLite storage engine and MooTools. I worked with iFixit's API and, for fun, styled the web app to look like their website (well, their website from back in January of 2014).
